# Styling & Theming [Make It Yours]

Muni uses a powerful and flexible styling system based on **Tailwind CSS**, with a theming architecture that allows for deep customization. This guide will walk you through the structure of the styling files and how you can customize the look and feel of your site.

## File Structure

All styling-related files are located in the `styles/` directory:

-   `globals.css`: The main entry point for all CSS, importing other style files.
-   `color-themes.css`: The core of the theming system, defining all color variables for different themes.
-   `shiki-theme.css`: Styles for code block syntax highlighting using Shiki.
-   `spacing.css`: Defines the vertical rhythm and spacing for the rendered MDX content.

## Tailwind CSS

The entire UI is built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework. You can customize the default Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`. Since this project uses postcss, the configuration is in `postcss.config.mjs`.

Most of the UI components in `components/ui/` use these utility classes. You can modify them directly or create your own components using the same system.

## Theming

Muni's theming is based on CSS variables, making it easy to create new themes or customize existing ones.

### `color-themes.css`

This is where the magic happens. The file defines a set of CSS variables for colors, fonts, and radius under the `:root` selector for the default light theme.

```css
:root {
  --radius: 0.625rem;
  --background: oklch(1 0 0);
  --foreground: oklch(0.147 0.004 49.25);
  /* ... and so on */
}
```

Dark mode and other themes are defined using class selectors:

```css
.dark {
  --background: oklch(0.147 0.004 49.25);
  --foreground: oklch(0.985 0.001 106.423);
  /* ... */
}

.arctic-light {
  /* ... */
}
```

The `theme-provider.tsx` in `components/providers/` handles switching between themes by changing the class on the `<html>` element.

### Adding a New Theme

To add a new theme, you can define a new class in `color-themes.css` with the same set of CSS variables.

## Code Block Styling

Code blocks are styled using `shiki-theme.css`. This file targets the HTML generated by [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) and applies styles for:

-   Background and text color for light and dark modes.
-   Line highlighting (`.highlighted`).
-   Line diffs (`.diff.add`, `.diff.remove`).
-   Focused lines (`.focused`).
-   Line numbers.

## MDX Content Spacing

The file `styles/spacing.css` controls the vertical spacing of elements within your MDX content (`.mdx-content`). It's designed to provide a clean and consistent reading experience out-of-the-box.

It uses a combination of `margin-top` and the adjacent sibling selector (`* + *`) to ensure proper rhythm. It also handles spacing for headings, lists, code blocks, and other elements.

```css
.mdx-content {
  /* Automatic spacing between all elements */
  & > * + * {
    margin-top: 1rem;
  }

  /* Smart heading spacing */
  & h2 {
    margin-top: 2rem;
    margin-bottom: 0.75rem;
  }
}
```

This setup ensures that you don't have to think about spacing while writing your documentation.
