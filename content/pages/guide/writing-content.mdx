# Writing Content

Creating content in Muni is straightforward. All of your pages are just MDX files located in the `content/pages` directory. The file path of your MDX file determines its public URL.

## Creating a New Page

1.  **Create a file:** Add a new `.mdx` file inside `content/pages`. For example, `content/pages/my-new-page.mdx`.
2.  **Add content:** Write your content using Markdown and MDX syntax.
3.  **Update navigation:** Open `muni.config.ts` and add a new entry to the `navigation` array. This will make your page appear in the sidebar.

    ```ts
    // muni.config.ts
    export const muniConfig = {
      title: "My Documentation",
      navigation: [
        // ... other items
        {
          title: "My New Page",
          slug: "my-new-page",
        },
      ],
    };
    ```

Your new page will now be available at `/docs/my-new-page`.

## Using MDX

MDX is Markdown with the power of React components. This means you can write standard Markdown, but also import and use components right in your content.

```mdx
import { MyCustomComponent } from '@/components/my-custom-component';

# This is a regular Markdown heading

This is a paragraph of text. You can use **bold** and *italic* formatting.

<MyCustomComponent />
```

To learn more about using components, see the [**Using Components**](/docs/guide/using-components) guide.

## Frontmatter

Frontmatter is a small block of YAML at the top of your MDX file that allows you to add metadata to your page. It's enclosed by triple-dashed lines (`---`).

```yaml
---
title: "A Custom Page Title"
description: "This description is used for SEO and search results."
---

# Your content starts here
```

### Core Properties

-   `title` (string): The main title of the page. This is used for the browser tab title and at the top of the page.
-   `description` (string): A brief summary of the page's content. This is crucial for SEO and for the site's internal search.

For a complete list of all available frontmatter options, see the [**Frontmatter API Reference**](/docs/api/frontmatter).
