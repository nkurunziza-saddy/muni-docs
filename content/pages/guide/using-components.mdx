# Using Components in MDX [Interactive Content]

One of the most powerful features of MDX is the ability to use React components directly in your Markdown content. Muni provides a set of useful built-in components and makes it easy to use your own.

## Built-in Components

Muni includes several components designed to help you create well-structured, readable documentation. These are available globally in all `.mdx` files.

### Callouts

Use callouts to highlight important information, warnings, or tips. They are created using the `:::` directive.

```mdx
:::info
This is an informational message.
:::

:::danger[Danger Zone]
This is a danger callout with a custom title.
:::

:::success
Your operation was successful!
:::
```

**Output:**

:::info
This is an informational message.
:::

:::danger[Danger Zone]
This is a danger callout with a custom title.
:::

:::success
Your operation was successful!
:::

### Steps

The `steps` component is perfect for creating step-by-step tutorials or guides. It automatically numbers the steps for you.

```mdx
:::steps

#### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run `pnpm install` to get started.

#### Step 2: Run the Server

Run `pnpm dev` to see your site.

#### Step 3: Build for Production

Run `pnpm build` to create a production build.

```

**Output:**

### Other Components

Muni also provides other useful components like `Aside`, `CodeGroup`, and `CopyButton`. For a full list and their options, see the [**Built-in Components Reference**](/docs/api/built-in-components).

## Using Your Own Components

You can import and use any React component in your MDX files, just like you would in any other React file.

### 1. Create Your Component

First, create your component file. For example, a simple `Welcome.tsx` component.

```tsx [components/Welcome.tsx]
import React from "react";

interface WelcomeProps {
  name: string;
}

export function Welcome({ name }: WelcomeProps) {
  return <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

### 2. Import and Use in MDX

Now, import it at the top of your `.mdx` file and use it like any other HTML tag.

```mdx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

<Button>Click Me</Button>
```

**Output:**

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

<Button>Click Me</Button>

This approach allows you to create highly interactive and dynamic documentation pages, from charts and graphs to live code editors.
