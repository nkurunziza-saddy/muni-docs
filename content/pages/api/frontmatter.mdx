# Frontmatter Reference [Page Metadata]

Frontmatter is the YAML block at the top of your MDX files, enclosed by triple dashes (`---`). It allows you to provide metadata for each page.

## Standard Properties

These are the primary properties that Muni uses to control page rendering and SEO.

### `title`

-   **Type:** `string`
-   **Required:** `true`
-   **Description:** The main title of the page. It is displayed at the top of the page content and used in the browser tab title (`<title>`).

### `description`

-   **Type:** `string`
-   **Required:** `true`
-   **Description:** A brief summary of the page content. This is critical for SEO as it is used for the `<meta name="description">` tag, and it also powers the text snippets in the site's search results.

## Custom Properties

You can add any other custom properties to your frontmatter. These properties are not used by Muni out-of-the-box, but they can be accessed from your own custom components or during the build process.

### Example with Custom Metadata

```yaml

title: "Advanced Tutorial"
description: "A guide to advanced component patterns."
author: "Jane Doe"
date: "2025-09-27"
version: "2.1.0"
tags: ["react", "advanced", "patterns"]
---

# Content starts here
```

### Accessing Custom Frontmatter

While Muni doesn't use custom frontmatter directly, you can configure your project to read it. For example, you could create a custom component that reads the `author` and `date` from the page's frontmatter.

This typically requires customizing the MDX loader or creating a wrapper component that has access to the page's metadata. The frontmatter is available to the page layout component.
