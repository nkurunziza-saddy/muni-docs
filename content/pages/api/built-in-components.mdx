# Built-in Components [The Toolbox]

Muni provides a set of powerful components that are globally available in all your MDX files. These are designed to help you create rich, structured content without needing to import them.

## Callouts

Callouts are used to highlight a block of text. They are created using the `:::` container directive.

- **Directive:** `:::[type]`
- **Supported Types:** `info`, `danger`, `success`, `warning`

```mdx
:::info[Optional Title]
This is an informational callout.
:::

:::danger
This is a danger callout.
:::
```

## Steps

The `steps` component creates an ordered, numbered list of steps, perfect for tutorials. It automatically numbers any `h4` heading within it.

- **Directive:** `:::steps`

```mdx
:::steps

#### Step 1: Do this first

Content for the first step.

#### Step 2: Do this next

Content for the second step.

:::
```

## CodeGroup

A component for displaying multiple code blocks in a tabbed view.

- **Directive:** `:::code-group`

````mdx
:::code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
const message: string = "Hello";
```

```js [JavaScript]
const message = "Hello";
```

:::
````

## CopyButton

This component is automatically added to every code block and provides a simple way for users to copy the code to their clipboard.

- **Usage:** Applied automatically. No directive needed.

## Aside

The `Aside` component renders content in a right-hand sidebar on larger screens, useful for showing supplementary information, examples, or API details alongside the main content.

- **Component:** `<Aside>`

````mdx
# Main Content Area

This is the primary content of the page. The `Aside` component will appear next to this on wide screens.

<Aside>

#### Supplementary Info

This content is displayed in the right sidebar. It can contain code blocks, text, and other components.

```ts
const example = "Hello, Aside!";
```

</Aside>
````
