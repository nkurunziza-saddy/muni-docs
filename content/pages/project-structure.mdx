# Project Structure

Understanding the file and directory structure of a Muni project is key to customizing your site and knowing where to add new content. Here is a high-level overview of the most important parts of the project.

```
muni-docs/
├── app/
│   └── docs/                 # Core documentation pages layout
├── components/
│   ├── muni-components/      # Built-in components for MDX
│   └── ui/                   # Core UI components (buttons, dialogs, etc.)
├── content/
│   └── pages/                # Your documentation MDX files live here
├── lib/
│   ├── hooks/                # Custom React hooks
│   └── plugins/              # Remark and Rehype plugins for MDX processing
├── mdx-components/
│   └── index.tsx             # Maps MDX elements to React components
├── public/                   # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── muni.config.ts            # Main configuration file for site navigation
└── next.config.ts            # Next.js and MDX configuration
```

## Key Directories

### `content/pages/`
This is where you'll spend most of your time. All of your documentation pages, written in MDX (`.mdx`), live in this directory. The file structure here maps directly to the URL structure of your site.

### `app/docs/`
The core Next.js App Router structure for the documentation pages. The layout file `app/docs/layout.tsx` is a great place to customize the overall page structure, like the sidebar and header.

### `components/`
This directory contains all the React components. It's split into two main subdirectories:
- `muni-components/`: Contains components that are intended to be used directly in your MDX files (e.g., `<Steps>`, `<CopyButton>`).
- `ui/`: Contains the low-level UI building blocks, like buttons, dialogs, and inputs, powered by `shadcn/ui`.

### `lib/`
Contains the business logic of the application. This includes custom hooks, search logic, and the powerful Remark and Rehype plugins that process your Markdown and add features like code block titles and callouts.

### `mdx-components/`
This directory is responsible for mapping standard Markdown elements (like `h1`, `p`, `code`) to custom React components. This is how the default styling is applied to your content. You can edit the files here to change how your content is rendered.

### `public/`
For all static assets. Any file in this directory can be referenced directly by its URL (e.g., `/file.svg`).

## Key Files

### `muni.config.ts`
This is the heart of your site's navigation. Here, you define the structure of your sidebar by listing all the pages and creating nested hierarchies. You also set the site title here.

### `next.config.ts`
This file configures Next.js itself. For Muni, its primary role is to set up the MDX loader and register all the Remark and Rehype plugins that give your Markdown superpowers.
