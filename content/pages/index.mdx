# Welcome to Muni

Muni is a powerful, modern documentation engine built with Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS. It's designed from the ground up to make creating beautiful, fast, and feature-rich documentation sites a seamless experience.

Whether you're documenting a software project, an API, or a design system, Muni provides the tools you need in a "batteries-included" package that is still fully customizable.

## Key Features

Muni comes packed with features that enhance both the authoring and reading experience.

### Write in MDX
Go beyond standard Markdown. With [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), you can embed custom React components directly into your documentation, creating rich, interactive content with ease.

### Feature-Rich Code Blocks
Present code beautifully with syntax highlighting, file names, line numbers, diffs, and even include code directly from your source files. Group related snippets into a single, tabbed component.

### Built-in Components
A suite of carefully crafted components like callouts, steps, and asides are available out-of-the-box to help you structure your content effectively.

### Blazing Fast Performance
Built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), Muni sites are statically generated by default. This means your documentation loads instantly, providing a great user experience and a boost for SEO.

### Customizable & Themeable
Leverage the full power of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to customize the look and feel of your site. The default theme is just a starting point.

### Integrated Search
Powerful, client-side search is built-in, allowing your users to find the information they need in an instant.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that documentation should be a joy to write and to read. Muni aims to remove the friction from the process by providing a robust, feature-complete foundation, so you can focus on what matters most: your content.
