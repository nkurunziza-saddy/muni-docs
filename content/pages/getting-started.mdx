# Getting Started

Welcome to Muni! This guide will walk you through setting up a new documentation project. We recommend using the official Muni template to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **pnpm** (recommended, but npm or yarn will also work)

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your documentation site up and running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the Muni starter template from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nkurunziza-saddy/muni-docs.git my-new-docs
```

### 2. Navigate to Project Directory

Change into your newly created project folder.

```bash
cd my-new-docs
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary dependencies using `pnpm`.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server to see your site in action.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your site should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`. Changes you make to the content will be automatically reflected.

## Next Steps

Now that your site is running, you can start creating content and customizing the project.

- Learn about the project layout in the [**Project Structure**](/docs/project-structure) guide.
- Start writing your first pages by following the [**Writing Content**](/docs/guide/writing-content) guide.
