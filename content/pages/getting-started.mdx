# Getting Started

Welcome to Muni! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## Installation

First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then follow these steps:

```bash

# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/muni-docs.git

# Navigate to the project directory

cd muni-docs

# Install dependencies

pnpm install

# Start the development server

pnpm dev
```

## Project Structure

Here's how your Muni project is organized:

```
muni-docs/
├── app/
│ ├── docs/
│ │ └── [[...slug]]/
│ │ └── page.tsx
│ └── layout.tsx
├── content/
│ └── pages/
│ ├── index.mdx
│ ├── getting-started.mdx
│ └── ...
├── components/
│ └── docs-layout.tsx
└── next.config.mjs
```

## Creating Content

To create new documentation pages:

1. Add a new `.mdx` file to the `content/pages/` directory
2. Update the navigation in `app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx`
3. Your page will be automatically available at `/docs/your-filename`
